# Windows 11 Refactor

Peekaboo is still macOS-first. The Windows fork now has a first native seam at
`Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11`.

## Current Slice

`PeekabooWin11` is a standalone Swift package that avoids AppKit, CoreGraphics,
ScreenCaptureKit, AXorcist, and macOS permission types. It consumes the neutral
desktop models and `DesktopAdapter` interface from `Core/PeekabooDesktop`, then
publishes Windows-named type aliases for Windows 11 automation primitives:

- display enumeration
- visible window enumeration
- application enumeration from window-owning processes
- full-screen or display BMP capture through Win32 GDI

The `peekaboo-win11` executable now delegates its basic command parsing to
`DesktopCommandRunner` in `PeekabooDesktop`. The Windows target owns native
adapter construction; the shared package owns the platform-neutral
`platform-info`, `list`, and `capture screen` command contract.

The production adapter is compiled only behind `#if os(Windows)` and imports
`WinSDK`. Non-Windows builds get `UnsupportedWin11DesktopAdapter`, which keeps
tests and documentation tooling from accidentally pretending the native backend
is available.

`PeekabooAutomationKit` also depends on `Core/PeekabooDesktop`, maps the
existing macOS service models into the neutral desktop models, and exposes
`MacAutomationDesktopAdapter` for async/main-actor macOS automation services.
That gives the main automation package a shared contract to target without
changing existing macOS runtime behavior. The main macOS CLI now uses that
adapter for the `list apps`, `list screens`, and `list windows` read paths
while preserving the existing JSON payload shapes. The neutral window model
now carries the cross-platform fields needed by CLI output, including z-order
index, screen, Space, off-screen, layer, alpha, and on-screen metadata.

## Why This Seam

The existing macOS implementation leaks platform types through service
interfaces: `CGRect`, `CGWindowID`, `NSScreen`, ScreenCaptureKit, Accessibility,
and AXorcist are spread across capture, observation, window, input, and CLI
modules. A direct rename from macOS services to Windows services would make the
interface nearly as complex as the implementation.

The shared desktop package starts with a smaller interface:

```swift
public protocol DesktopAdapter: Sendable {
    func platformInfo() -> DesktopPlatformInfo
    func listDisplays() throws -> [DesktopDisplay]
    func listWindows(includeInvisible: Bool) throws -> [DesktopWindow]
    func listApplications() throws -> [DesktopApplication]
    func captureScreen(displayIndex: Int?, outputPath: String) throws -> DesktopCaptureResult
}
```

It also exposes `DesktopAsyncAdapter` for platform services that are naturally
async or actor-isolated. A sync-to-async bridge keeps the Win32 adapter usable
from async call sites without forcing the Windows CLI path to change.

`DesktopCommandRunner` sits above that interface so early platform CLIs do not
need to duplicate argument parsing, JSON envelopes, help text, or validation
rules while each platform backend is still being filled in.

That module is deliberately deep: callers get app/window/display/capture
behavior without learning HWND lifetimes, GDI device contexts, UTF-16 buffers,
BMP/PNG file details, or platform-specific actor isolation.

## Build

On Windows 11 with Swift installed:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\build-win11.ps1
```

Or directly:

```powershell
swift build --package-path Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11
swift test --package-path Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11
```

## Run

```powershell
swift run --package-path Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11 peekaboo-win11 platform-info
swift run --package-path Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11 peekaboo-win11 list displays
swift run --package-path Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11 peekaboo-win11 list windows
swift run --package-path Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11 peekaboo-win11 list apps
swift run --package-path Platforms/Windows/PeekabooWin11 peekaboo-win11 capture screen --path .\screen.bmp
```

## Next Integration Steps

1. Continue routing the main macOS CLI capture read paths through the same
   desktop adapter contract where the existing output behavior can be
   preserved.
2. Add Windows implementations for input and UI Automation after capture and
   enumeration have stable test coverage.
